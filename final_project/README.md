# Training Scheduling

In this project I build a django application that handels organising training classes or conference room reservations.
I got the Idea from the company I work in, sometimes trainers and managers have problems keeping track of which class or room is free to use and which are reserved.

I believe that the complexity of my project is sufficient.
